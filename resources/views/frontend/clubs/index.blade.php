                                    <br>
                                    Civil engineers are involved in monitoring and guiding as well as devising and designing the building of roads, girders, bridges, airports, harbours, tunnels, dams, water & sewage systems, buildings and other structures. Civil engineering is one of the oldest disciplines of engineering and contains a variety of specialties like structural, water related, environmental, transportation and geo-technical engineering.  Civil engineers are responsible for planning and designing a project, constructing the project to the required scale, and maintenance of the product. Civil engineers require not only a high standard of engineering knowledge but also supervisory and administrative skills. Administrative or supervisory jobs are held by many civil engineers while others work in devising, composing, constructing, researching and teaching jobs. The period through 2015 is projected to hold growth and potential for civil engineers. Due to the growth of population and the need for better infrastructural as well as planning, civil engineers will be required to build and design larger and safer buildings, complexes, transport facilities, as well as more durable water supply, sewage and pollution control mechanisms. Controlling environmental pollution, managing traffic congestion, improving road safety, and disaster management will be a big challenge. Repairing existing roads, dams and other public conveniences will also be a major work allotment.
